## 2024-05-23 - Smart Duration Selection
**Learning:** Flat lists with > 50 options (like minute-by-minute duration pickers) are overwhelming. Grouping options by scale (Minutes vs Hours) and using variable granularity (5m for short, 15m/30m for long) significantly improves scanability without sacrificing utility.
**Action:** Always group large select lists with `<optgroup>` and consider non-linear scales for range-based inputs.
