The database migrations have been squashed into a single initialization file `20260126100000_init.sql`. The schema uses `telegram_id` as the primary key for users, merges calendar data into the `users` table, and includes optimized time types for events. Enums for event attendees are standardized as `attendee_role` and `participation_status`. Following these changes, always use `just db-reset` to ensure the local environment matches the consolidated schema.
